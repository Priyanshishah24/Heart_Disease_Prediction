# Heart_Disease_Prediction
I used different models to get better accuracy of the data using Machine Learning
Problem Definition:
      Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease.

Data:
     This Dataset contains of 303 Rows & 14 columns . Our Target column represent whether the Patient is having heart disease or not , where 0 represent patient is not having heart disease and 1 represent patient is having heart disease.

Evaluation:
      We need to try at least 80% accuracy of the model to pursue the project.
